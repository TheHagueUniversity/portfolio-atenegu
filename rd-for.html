    <h2>First research project - to make an etnoghraphic description</h2>

    <p>My chosen subculture was a protestan church located in Scheveningen. I chose a church particulary because I am not religious.</p>
    <p>The research project was very intereting and insightful - I got to visit peoples homes, talk abou their lives and choices.</p>
