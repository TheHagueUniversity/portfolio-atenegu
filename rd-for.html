    <h2>First research project - to make an etnoghraphic description</h2>

    <p>My chosen subculture was a protestan church located in Scheveningen. I chose a church particulary because I am not religious.</p>
    <!-- <p>The research project was very interesting and insightful - I got to visit peoples homes, talk about their lives and choices.</p> -->
    <p>I believe that this was the most interesting project so far.</p>
